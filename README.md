# AeroMesh system

This is a work in progress mesh based system of sensors aimed at being deployed on small sailboats and other applications where wiring network and power is hard or impossible. The design aims to allow zero (or minimal) configuration integration of new sensors to the mesh as well as compatibility with regular (NMEA2k, etc) marine technology. 
Each sensor is based on a ESP8266, enabling it to have wireless connectivity to other sensors and providing their own data to the data mesh. This project includes the firware for different sensors and exemple board design for them.

**This project (and it's documentation) is still under heavy developpement in my free time**
